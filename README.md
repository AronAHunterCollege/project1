Outline:
This is a simple choose your own adventure game where the user creates a world.
By pressing the buttonns animations play which correlate with what the user puts in the world.

I used figma to get a general sense for the layout and basic flow of the project.

The project has a few distinct GSAP animations which I researched how to make that match with the choice being made.
I used a simple whoosh sound when pressing an option to convey the objects being made and a sort of cinematic sound for restarting that sounds like everything is being removed.
Users click on buttons to progress.
The layout of the page adjusts to fit any display and all animations are compatatible with all display sizes.

HTML, CSS, and JS were used alongside the GSAP library and GitHub for posting and Figma for design.

My original vision was to also create a visual of the planet such as creating buildings or trees but I didn't have the time.
